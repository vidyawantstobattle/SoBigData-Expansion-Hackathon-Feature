# SoBigData-Expansion-Hackathon-Feature

This repository expands upon the Software Architecture of the [SoBigData](http://www.sobigdata.eu/) website: http://www.sobigdata.eu/ by proposing the implementation and integration of:
1. Conducting Hackathons driven by the industries which align with the values of SoBigData
2. Conducting promotional & networking events about, but not limited to, the aforementioned Hackathons
3. Automating the testcases on which the Hackathon solution is judged
4. Offering support during Hackathons by answering general queries

A detailed report of the work done can be found in the SoBigData - Hackathons PDF file ([./SoBigData - Hackathons.pdf](https://github.com/vidyawantstobattle/SoBigData-Expansion-Hackathon-Feature/blob/9557cb493d4cd130eb4863804b0cc9798017c4ca/SoBigData%20-%20Hackathons.pdf)https://github.com/vidyawantstobattle/SoBigData-Expansion-Hackathon-Feature/blob/9557cb493d4cd130eb4863804b0cc9798017c4ca/SoBigData%20-%20Hackathons.pdf).
